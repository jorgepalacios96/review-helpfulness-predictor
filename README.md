**Purpose:**

Most of people look in the review section of Amazon before taking a decision to purchase, to see if other customers have found the product useful. The more helpful the review has been for other users, the higher will appear in the webpage, based on a voting system. However, there are online shops, mainly medium and small companies with fewer resources and poor websites, who have not developed a recommendator system or do not have a big userbase, where all comments are mixed or based on the last written. My algorithm would help to classify reviews by their helpfulness based on Natural Language Processing techniques, without the need of human intervention.


**Analysis:** Here are the three main three fields of study of each review:
* Gramatical analysis: (length, number of sentences, number of special characters, upper-case characters...)
* Readability (Automated Readability Index, Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test)
* Sentiment, subjectivity and polarity.


**Content of this repo:**
* File containing the code used to perform the analysis.
* Presentation (PDF format)
