**Introduction:**

Most of people look in the review section of Amazon before taking a decision to purchase, to see if other customers have found the product useful. The more helpful the review has been for other users, the higher will appear in the webpage, based on a voting system by users. However, there are online shops, mainly medium and small companies with fewer resources and poor websites, who have not developed a recommendator system or do not have a big userbase, where all comments are mixed or based on the last written. My algorithm would help to classify reviews by their helpfulness based on Natural Language Processing techniques, without the need of human intervention.

**Data analysis:**
Hereâ€™s a list of the major computations done to explore, clean and process the data:
* Database import
* Columns renaming
* Database filtering to get only Spanish data
* New database import
